Bitwise Utility Tool (C Mini Project)

Project Description
The Bitwise Utility Tool is a menu-driven console application developed using the C programming language.
This project allows users to perform basic bitwise operations on integer values and view the results instantly.
The project is designed for students to understand how bitwise operators work at the binary level in a practical way.

This project was created to:
Understand the working of bitwise operators practically
Strengthen core C programming concepts
Apply theoretical knowledge in a real program
Fulfill academic mini-project requirements
Create a well-documented project for GitHub
Bitwise operations are important in system programming, embedded systems, and low-level applications, which makes this project educationally valuable.

Utility of the Project

The Bitwise Utility Tool is useful for:
Students learning C programming
Understanding binary manipulation
Practicing menu-driven programs
Academic assignments and mini projects
Demonstrating C skills on GitHub
